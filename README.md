# Doppix

Doppix is a lightweight tool for deduplicating and clustering images using conventional image processing techniques. It leverages perceptual hashing to group similar imagesâ€”making it easy to clean up large image collections without any AI.

## Features

- **Conventional Methods:** Uses average hashing (aHash) to capture the visual essence of an image.
- **Efficient Clustering:** Groups images by comparing hash values with a configurable Hamming distance threshold.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Built with Python using simple libraries like Pillow and imagehash.
- **Easy Setup:** Designed to work out-of-the-box for batch processing large datasets.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/doppix.git
   cd doppix


2. **Install Dependencies:**

    Ensure you have docker installed. Then run:
    ```bash
    docker compose build

## Usage

### Prepare Your Images:
Place your images in a directory. Update the `image_folder` variable in the script (e.g., `doppix.py`) to point to your images folder.

### Run the Script:
Execute the script to start clustering:

    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    
## Review the Output:
The script will output the clusters with each group containing paths to similar images.

## Configuration

### Threshold Adjustment:

The script uses a Hamming distance threshold (default is 5) to determine similarity. Adjust this value in the cluster_images function as needed to fine-tune clustering sensitivity.
